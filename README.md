# hierarchical-clustering
I implemented a hierarchical clustering algorithm to be used on a dataset of cancer patients and their digitized gene data. Using matplotlib, I plotted the final dendogram, showing the clusters that each observation roughly falls into.
 
 Below are heatmaps of the data before the clustering was applied and after.
